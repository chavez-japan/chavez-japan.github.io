            <p>Hello, my name is Jose Chavez. I am a sophmore in MiraCosta College pursuing an Associate's degree in Web Development and Design plus a Bachelor's in Computer Science. For a month, I will be studying at Kyoto, Japan with Citrus College. Fortunately I have enough for the tuition but struggle with the living expenses. The purpose of this website is simply to gather as much money as I can through ads. Probably won't be much, but it's something.</p>
