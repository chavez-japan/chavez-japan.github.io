                <p>Hello, my name is Jose Chavez. I am a sophmore in MiraCosta College pursuing an Associate's degree in Web Development and Design plus a Bachelor's in Computer Science. For a month, I will be studying at Kyoto, Japan with Citrus College. Fortunately I have enough for the tuition but struggle with the living expenses. The purpose of this website is simply to gather as much money as I can through ads. Probably won't be much, but it's something.</p>

            <h3 class="impTitle">Upcoming Journey to Japan</h3>
            <p>Out of all the other countries, I choose to go to Japan. To study, get college credits, and experience the country I most look forward to based on its beauty, culture, music, and language. Japan will be the first country that I have traveled to, excluding Mexico because I was too young to remember <span class="hide-note">(All I remember was being stuck in my grandparent's bathroom because I didn't know how to open the door)</span>, which is very exciting! The thought of being far from home, being independent <span class="hide-note">(At least for a month)</span>, and exploring to my free will excites me. Surely there are probably some restrictions just because I <i>am</i> studying abroad, not really a vacation trip, but either ways, looking forward to it! As much as I would love to travel around the country, I will be going to Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Nara. Plans of going to Tokyo is still unsure. I do plan in trying to make as many contacts as possible, despite my social awkwardness and anxiety, to improve my Japanese as the current level I am in is N5. Now my conversations aren't always <i>savoir faire</i> but that's why I hope to converse with many natives!</p>

            <h4>Program Details</h4>
            <p>"Kyoto is the cultural heart of Japan. The former home of the Emperor, Kyoto was the capital of Japan for over 1,000 years. This rich cultural history lives on through Kyoto's people, food, shrines, temples, gardens, and festivals. Students will earn three to six units of CSU/UC transferable credits towards their degree while experiencing the beauty and uniqueness of Kyoto and the Kansai area. In addition to Kyoto's cultural and historic charms, students will also have the opportunity to visit Nara and the nearby, neon-lit metropolis of Osaka."â€‹</p>

            <h3 class="impTitle">Food & Travel (Oh, Studies too...)</h3>
            <p>There are only a few places I'll tour at, provided by the program, but there are other few locations planned by the group itself. They are: Tokyo, Tokyo Disney, and summer festivals are a few that were discussed, which isn't a lot due to the short time length and time investment for classes, going too far might not be ideal. Ordering from chronological order, based on the draft program itinerary, the first location will be the Taizo-in Temple during the morning. That same day, there will be an optional excursion to Fushimi Inari, which is definite yes to my end! The next will be a guided tour at Nijo Castle, which I never heard of so I am looking forward to learn about that. There will be Cooking classes with Sake Tasting but depending on what group I am put into, which I am fine with, I am in no rush to taste sake nor cooking. Cooking is out of my expertise... Anyways, between those activities will be a visit to Nanzeji Temple! From the look of it, we will be visiting many locations rather than sticking in a classroom. In all honesty, it is a great balance as they assist us with what to do and the liberty in our own activities.
            <br>Now, this was an optional excursion that I signed up for, weekend in Hiroshima. I don't have to go in too much detail as it can be found in any History textbook but the group who signed up for it will be at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. I am unsure if it's guided, but I am assuming it is not. 
            <br>The last excursion will be a full day to Nara. A walking tour for <b>4 long hours</b> plus visiting the Todai-ji. As much as I like walking, I heard the weather during the summer is flippin' hot, so wearing shorts will be very common although I hate them. ðŸ˜¢
            <br>I haven't been looking but will look for a running group in Japan just to continue my passion for running <span class="hide-notes">(Although I have injured myself for the past few weeks)</span>. I don't really have too many activities planned on my own but will keep this up-to-date when something comes up!~</p>
