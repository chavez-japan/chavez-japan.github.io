            <h1>Arriving in Japan</h1>
            <p>Everybody knows that going to Japan from the US takes a long time. I reside in California 
                so it was supposed to take about roughly around 12 hours to get there, but I was unfortunate enough to be in there for a longer time.
                Apperantly, something was going wrong in Osaka, our city to descend, so we hovered there for half an hour. Everybody 
                in my study abroad group was excited to go to their dorms and rest, but sleep had to wait. After we got word, we were informed 
                that we were going to land in Tokyo. Now the group had mixed feelings about that. Some were excited about it, others were not.
                It took us an hour to get there, and it was raining cats and dogs, so nobody was looking forward to get out.
            </p>

            <p>I was relieved when we were getting out but for some odd reason, we had to a security check and then go back into the plane.
                Nobody understands why, but we were obligitated. Now that we landed, some of the group members contacted the program's 
                orginizer and she said either we will stay in Tokyo for the night and find a way to go back to Kyoto, where our program will
                be at, or there will be a late bus to pick us up after we go head back to Osaka.
